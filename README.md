# React Native Quiz App

This is a simple React Native quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. The app features two types of quiz components: Fill in the Blank and Flashcards.

Implemented features:

1. Fill in the Blank: Users type their answers into a text input field, and the app checks if the provided answer is correct or incorrect.
2. Flashcard: Users can reveal the answer by tapping the "Reveal Answer" button.

You can view the live version of the app using React Native Web (if no native-only components are used) at the following GitHub Pages site: [your GitHub Pages link here]
